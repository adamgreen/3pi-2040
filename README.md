I saw a link for this new [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 Early Adopter Robot Kit](https://www.pololu.com/product/5004) show up on the **Personal Robotics** Discord Server yesterday and it really caught my eye:
* I really like the look of it. It reminds me of the [RugRover project](https://github.com/adamgreen/rugrover#readme) that I have been working on recently but much nicer than anything I could design myself.
* I also like that it uses the RP2040 microcontroller as its brain. I have done some experimenting in the past with the RP2040. Some of my previous RP2040 projects include:
  * https://github.com/adamgreen/i2cperipheral
  * https://github.com/adamgreen/QuadratureDecoder
* Gives me an opportunity to continue with a little bit more MicroPython exploration and then go deeper into C/C++ programming of the RP2040.
* Quite a bit of bang for the buck.

In the end I decided it looked so cool that I purchased one this evening and started this GitHub repository to document my time with the bot once it arrives.
